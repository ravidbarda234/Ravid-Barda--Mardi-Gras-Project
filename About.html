    <h1>About Mardi Gras</h1>
    <br />><br />
    
    <div class="about-container">
      <!-- <div class="info-About"> -->
      <p class="p1">
        The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing
        through Rome and Venice in the 17th and 18th centuries to the French
        House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf
        Gras," or fatted calf, followed France to her colonies.
      </p>
      <p class="p2">
        On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur
        de Bienville arrived at a plot of ground 60 miles directly south of New
        Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his men realized it
        was the eve of the festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort
        Louis de la Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in 1702. In 1703, the tiny
        settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated America's very first
        Mardi Gras.
      </p>
      <p class="p3">
        In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile),
        similar to those that form our current Mardi Gras krewes. It lasted
        until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and paraded
        from 1711 through 1861. The procession was held with a huge bull's head
        pushed along on wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade with an actual
        bull, draped in white and signaling the coming Lenten meat fast. This
        occurred on Fat Tuesday.
      </p>
      <p class="p4">
        New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi
        Gras was celebrated openly in New Orleans, but not with the parades we
        know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the Marquis de
        Vaudreuil, established elegant society balls, which became the model for
        the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls of today.
      </p>
      <p class="p5">
        The following year, floats began to be constructed entirely in New
        Orleans instead of France, culminating with Comus' magnificent "The
        Missing Links to Darwin's Origin of Species," in which exotic
        paper-mache' animal costumes served as the basis for Comus to mock both
        Darwin's theory and local officials, including Governor Henry Warmoth.
        In 1875, Governor Warmoth signed the "Mardi Gras Act," making Fat
        Tuesday a legal holiday in Louisiana, which it still is. Like Comus and
        the Twelfth Night Revelers, most Mardi Gras krewes today developed from
        private social clubs with restrictive membership policies. Since all of
        these parade organizations are completely funded by their members, New
        Orleanians call it the "Greatest Free Show on Earth!"
      </p>
      <p class="p6">
        By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with
        carriages and horseback riders to celebrate Mardi Gras. Dazzling
        gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members
        and lent each event an exciting air of romance and festivity. In 1856,
        six young Mobile natives formed the Mistick Krewe of Comus, invoking
        John Milton's hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus brought
        magic and mystery to New Orleans with dazzling floats (known as tableaux
        cars) and masked balls. Krewe members remained anonymous.
      </p>
      <p class="p7">
        In 1870, Mardi Gras' second Krewe, the Twelfth Night Revelers, was
        formed. This is also the first recorded account of Mardi Gras "throws."

        LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American
        politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana since May 7,
        2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office. Before
        becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans City
        Council from 2012–2018.
